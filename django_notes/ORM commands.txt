                    * filter student age 

Student.objects.filter(age__gt=25) # This shows the students greater then 25

Student.objects.filter(age__gte=25) # This shows the students less then or equals to 18
Student.objects.filter(age__in=[21, 20, 45, 32]) # This shows the student that's age of 21, 20, 45, 32 (this is used to get the data in bulk and can be use in other fileds like name , address ...)






                    * filter student by the letter contains in their name
        
Student.objects.filter(name__contains"n") # This shows the students whose name have letter "n" at anywhere but it's case sensetive means it only shows the name where samll n is used
Student.objects.filter(name__icontains"n") # This is same as above but that after including "i" infront of contains this became case insensitive. No matter captital or small n this shows every (n, N) in the name

* Count the student *


Student.objects.all().count() # This count all the students
Student.objects.filter(name__startswith="j").count() # This counts the students whose name starts with j



* get student by order *
Student.objects.all().order_by('id') # This shows the students by the order of id in ascending order
Student.objects.all().order_by('-id') # This shows the students by the order of id in decending order
